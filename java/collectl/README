This example implements a simple Java application which listens on a
TCP socket for time series data corresponding to the Collectl wire protocol.
The commonly-available 'collectl' tool can be used to send example data
to the server.

This tutorial assumes that you are running a Kudu master on localhost.

To start the example server:

$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/kudu-collectl-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

To start collecting data, run the following command on one or more machines:

$ collectl --export=graphite,127.0.0.1,p=/

(substituting '127.0.0.1' with the IP address of whichever server is running the
example program).
