Random insert load generator. This will insert as fast as it can using
AUTO_BACKGROUND_FLUSH with the specified number of threads. All fields are
randomized, and insert failures (including errors from collisions) are ignored.

To build and run, do the following:

$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/kudu-insert-loadgen-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar kudu_master_host kudu_table_name num_threads

For example, if you are running the Quickstart VM with the host name
"quickstart.cloudera", then you can use:

$ java -jar target/kudu-insert-loadgen-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar quickstart.cloudera test_table 16

Note: This program will not create the "test_table" table. You must do that
via other means, such as through impala-shell or using the create-demo-table
program included in the Kudu source tree.
